            Systematic Literature Review
          </h2>

          <p>
            Is there a topic in your field that warrants a systematic review? We can help you conceptualize, design and execute the review: search parameters, inclusion/exclusion criteria, sorting and filtering, providing assessments on the evidence quality level according to standardized scales. We can help summarise the literature according to thematic criteria, provide interpretation of what the body of evidence suggests, as well as speculate on what might be coming next.
