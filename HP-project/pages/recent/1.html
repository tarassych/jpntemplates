            Safety and Efficacy of Minimally Interrupted Dabigatran vs Uninterrupted Warfarin Therapy in Adults
            Undergoing Atrial Fibrillation Catheter Ablation:
            <br>
            A Randomized Clinical Trial
          </h2>

          <p>
            In this randomized clinical trial of 442 participants undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation, 2
            thromboembolic events occurred in the warfarin group before ablation, but none in the dabigatran group.
            Major bleeding and thromboembolic event rates were 1.4% and 0, respectively, in the dabigatran group (n =
            220) and 5.0% and 0.5%, respectively, in the warfarin group (n = 222) from the start of the ablation
            procedure until 3 months after ablation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Meaning: In this patient population, minimally interrupted dabigatran therapy did not increase
            thromboembolic events and was associated with fewer bleeding complications than uninterrupted warfarin
            therapy.

          <p>
            Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been recommended for the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). Although
            inter-racial differences exist regarding the appropriate dose and efficacy of MMF in patients with LN, no
            definitive meta-analysis has yet been conducted in Chinese patients. This analysis investigated the efficacy
            and safety of MMF in Chinese patients with proliferative LN.

            Predicting outcomes with machine learning: a study of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer

          <p>
            Machine learning is a powerful tool that can help predict clinical outcomes in a range of diseases. This
            study used machine learning to identify factors that could predict clinical outcomes in patients with
            castration-resistant prostate cancer being treated with cabazitaxel.
