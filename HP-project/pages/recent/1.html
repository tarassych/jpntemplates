            Mycophenolate mofetil in the treatment of Chinese patients with lupus nephritis
          </h2>

          <p>
            Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been recommended for the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). Although
            inter-racial differences exist regarding the appropriate dose and efficacy of MMF in patients with LN, no
            definitive meta-analysis has yet been conducted in Chinese patients. This analysis investigated the efficacy
            and safety of MMF in Chinese patients with proliferative LN.

          <p>
            This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the value of preoperative
            thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in assessing the risk of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in
            patients with thyroid nodules.
