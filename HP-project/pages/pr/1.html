          Our dedicated medical writers work as a true extension of your team. Following your guidance, we develop an
          outline of the manuscript and get your feedback and input. Once the structure is agreed upon, we develop the
          full draft. Projects go through 2 outline stages and 2-3 drafts before being ready for submission.

          <p>
            We work to understand your goals and objectives. We really try to get to the heart of what you are trying to
            do. Once we have a good understanding, we start generating ideas.

            can make an informed decision about which route to take.

            Once a solution is decided upon we further develop it. We walk you through the solution, give you time to
